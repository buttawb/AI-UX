I can't directly create and return a base64-encoded MP4 video file.  I'm a text-based AI and don't have access to the system resources needed to generate videos, encode them, and manage file transfers.


However, I *can* provide you with a detailed script/storyboard for a video simulating the user journey, along with UX analysis and suggestions for how you could create the video yourself using a screen recording tool and video editing software.



**Storyboard and UX Analysis:**

1. **Scene 1: Splash Screen (0-3 seconds):**
   - Video opens on the splash screen.
   - Text Overlay: "User launches the Linked Union app."

2. **Scene 2:  Initial Chat Form (3-10 seconds):**
   - Transition to the chat pre-registration form (Frame 4603).
   - Visual indicator (a colored circle or highlighting effect) appears around the "Full Name" field.
   - Text Overlay: "User is prompted to enter their name before starting the chat."
   - Simulated typing animation in the "Full Name" field. Example entry: "John Doe".
   - Visual indicator moves to "Email" field.
   - Simulated typing animation in the "Email" field. Example entry: "john.doe@example.com"
   - UX Note:  It's good practice to allow users to start a chat without registration, but collecting some information helps with later follow-up.

3. **Scene 3: Start Chat (10-15 seconds):**
   - Visual indicator appears on the "Start Chat" button (Frame 1581).
   - Text Overlay: "User clicks 'Start Chat'."
   - Transition to the chat screen (Frame 4605).

4. **Scene 4:  Initial Chat Interaction (15-25 seconds):**
   - The chat interface is displayed, showing the welcome message from Linked Union.
   - Text Overlay: "User begins interacting with the chatbot."
   - Simulated chat messages from both the user and the chatbot appear.  (The content of these messages isn't essential to this task demonstration)


5. **Scene 5: Open Menu (25-30 seconds):**
   - Visual indicator appears on the menu icon (Menu 1 adjacent to Frame 2268).
   - Text Overlay: "User clicks the menu icon."
   - Menu (Frame 4210) slides open from the right. 
   - UX Note: Consider a hamburger menu icon instead of the three-dot icon, as it is more universally recognized as a menu button.


6. **Scene 6: Change Name (30-40 seconds):**
   - Visual indicator appears on the "Change Name" menu item (Frame 41).
   - Text Overlay: "User clicks 'Change Name'."
   - Transition to a name change screen (Frame 2469).  (You may need to design this screen, as it's not explicitly present in the provided data).
   - Simulated typing animation in the name field. Example entry:  "Jane Doe".
   - Visual indicator appears on a "Save" button (you'll need to add this to the name change screen).
   - Text Overlay: "User saves the name change."

7. **Scene 7: Change Email (40-50 seconds):**
    - Transition back to the menu (Frame 4210 if the menu disappears after name change, otherwise show the existing menu).
    - Visual indicator appears on the menu icon again if a new menu transition is necessary.
    - Text Overlay: "User accesses the menu again". (If needed).
    - Visual indicator appears on "Change Email" (design this new menu item).
    - Text Overlay: "User clicks 'Change Email'."
    - Transition to an email change screen (design this screen similar to the name change screen).
    - Simulated typing animation in the email field. Example entry:  "jane.doe@example.com"
    - Visual indicator appears on a "Save" button.
    - Text Overlay: "User saves the email change."


8. **Scene 8: Return to Chat / Success (50-60 seconds):**
   - Transition back to the chat screen (Frame 4605).
   - Text Overlay: "Name and email successfully changed.  User continues chatting." 
   - Optional: Briefly flash the updated name in the chat interface to confirm the change. 



**Video Creation Suggestions:**

* **Software:** Use screen recording tools (e.g., QuickTime, OBS Studio) and video editing software (e.g., DaVinci Resolve, iMovie, Adobe Premiere Pro).
* **Visual Indicators:** Create these using your video editing software.  Animated circles, highlighting, or arrows work well.
* **Text Overlays:** Add these using text tools in your editing software.  Choose a clear font and appropriate size.
* **Transitions:** Simple cross-dissolves or fades usually work best for UX demonstrations.
* **Progress Indicator:** Include a progress bar or timestamps in the video.
* **Timing:** Aim for natural pauses between actions.  Don't make the interactions too fast or too slow.


By following these steps, you can create a professional and effective video simulation of the user journey for changing their name and email within the Linked Union chat application.  Remember to focus on clarity, realism, and educational value.
